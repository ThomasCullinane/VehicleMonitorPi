# VehiclePiSense
Comp Sys Assignment 2

Use RPi with a sense hat to create a Vehicle monitor system.
Base case would be;
> to use the gyroscope and accelerometer to identify incidents (might take some fine tuning for a car but for a bike gyroscope should be good)

> allow driver interaction by pressing the on board button to cancel assistance

> send notification to someone if there is no interaction (or possibly anyway)

> additionaly setting it as a theft monitor by using another device to change the setting from incident to movement

Added functionality that could be investigated:
> use of a bluetooth odbc connection to provide additional data from the car

> use of gps to provide additional information, possibly connecting to speed zones and use of the sense hat leds to provide feedback

> automated storing of data to a server for future investigation.

> include video camera footage and possibly remote video access through connected phone in car or home wifi if in theft monitor mode
